 - Add shaking animation to planet when clicked
 - Add different icons/logos for clicker upgrades and upgrade shop?
 - Add more upgrades
 - As upgrades progress the planet should also progress. Water, plant life, civilization, etc.
 - Eventually add different currency besides stardust
 - Figure out a skill tree? Critical hits, speed boosts, idle clickers/workers. etc. 
 - Maybe skills are bought through amounts of clicks or a different 'currency'
